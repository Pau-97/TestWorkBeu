# The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this clock application and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You'll be using the following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) to set the city and country underneath the time

Additionally you need to create an API that returns suggested quotes to later consume them in the Frontend.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

### Expected Behaviour

- Change the greeting depending on the time of day. It should say:
  - "Good morning" between 5am and 12pm
  - "Good afternoon" between 12pm and 6pm
  - "Good evening" between 6pm and 5am
- Change the greeting icon and background image depending on the time of day. They should show:
  - The sun icon and the daytime background image between 5am and 6pm
  - The moon icon and the nighttime background image between 6pm and 5am
- Generate a new random programming quote whenever the refresh icon is clicked

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide a Figma versions of the design. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file called `clock-app.fig` will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Create a folder for the `frontend` code and another for the `backend` code.

## Deploying your project

There are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers.
